        <p>TechRepublic Tablet Experience</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Techrepublic is a 15-year-old site under CBSi that publishes curated and original content targeting CIOs and business executives. Over the years, the site has accumulated more that 2 million global monthly viewers, despite its legacy look and feel. <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/">Take a look.</a> </h3>

        <h4>An Intern Project</h4>
        <h3>I worked at CBSi as a product intern during the summer 2014. I was tasked to redesign Techrepublic's article viewing experience for tablet. The orginal tablet site was merely a "shrinked" version of the web, which is a 2-column site that's too overloaded for tablet.</h3>

        <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/TR/currentTR.jpg" alt="">

        <h4>Goals and Struggles</h4>
        <h3>As a designer, I always want to optimize for user experience. But in a big company, there are many different departments that all wanted different things on the site. For example, the sales department requires us to have 5-7 ad inventories in one article page. The editorial/sales departments needed to put a link for white paper download. With so many requirements from so many stakeholders competing for limited screen asset, it's a headache to begin designing.</h3><br>
        <h3>Therefore, the goal, is to balance the needs of all internal stakeholders and business goals, while creating the best user experience possible.</h3>

        <h4>Data: Tablet users behave differenly</h4>
        <h3>By segmenting and analyzing user data, I found that tablet users have a very different set of behaviors than both desktop and mobile users. While most people from desktop and mobile visit during work hours, tablet users tend to browse during weekends. Tablet users also show higher engagements across various metrics such as time spent/visit.</h3>

        <br>

        <h3><span>Hypothesis:</span> Tablet users use the site to casually catch up tech news, rather than looking up work related information like desktop and mobile users do. </h3>

        <br>

        <h3>There are three main traffic sources: search engine, bookmarked, social media. While visitors from search account for the majority, they tend to be less engaged and have higher bounce rate.</h3>

        <br>

        <h3><span>Hypothesis:</span> People from search engine are not finding useful content.</h3>
        <h3><span>Hypothesis:</span> The site fails to attract people to view more content other than what they original searched for.</h3>

        <h4>Business Goals and KPIs</h4>
        <h3>After discussion with my manager, it became clear to us that the Business would be better off if we can increase pageviews/UV and the number of loyal users (measured by frequency of returns). Theoretically, a better user experience should serve these goals. Another thing my manager wanted to try out was to increase reach in social media because our social  presence had been lacking behind competitors such as CIO.com and Mashable.</h3>

        <h4>Optimizing Content and Navigation</h4>
        <h3>To increase pageviews/UV and loyalty, I decided that the redesign should focus on optimizing content and navigation.</h3>
          <p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/TR/trdesignconcept.jpg" alt=""></p>

        <h4>Landscape Research</h4>  
          <p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/TR/research.png" alt=""></p>

        <h3>By researching every interaction and layout structure of a dozen of competitor sites, I was able to compare how each of their design tried to accommodate similar product requirements, such as how to embed ads and other content discovery elements.</h3>
        <h3>I was also able to learn how each attempted to increase social reach. For example, Mashable has a fixed top nav bar for social sharing when you scroll down. And it becomes search bar if you scroll up.</h3>

        <h4>Iterating the Nav</h4>
        <h3>Based on the these research, it was clear to me that the nav bar was important. Here's some of my early iterations. I was making the search bar more prominent because from data we knew that people were using the search function, despite it being so hard to access in the original design.</h3>
        <p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/TR/nav.png" alt=""></p>

        <h4>The Lost Wireframes</h4>
        <h3>Unfortunately, I have dropped my wireframes somewhere. They should still live in some files under the CBSi file management system. Reach out to them if you are that interested!</h3>

        <h4>But here are the mockup iterations</h4>
        <br>
        
          <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/TR/onecol.png" alt="">
        <br><br>
        <h3><span>One Column:</span> the layout clears up clutter and honors the content. A big image is used to attract attention and encourage scrolling down.</h3>
        <h3><span>Embedded Content Discovery:</span> Minimal-look "Editor's pick" right after the first paragraph (where people decides whether or not the article is relevant, as shown by fallout and scroll depth data). This allows people to discover other content if they decided what they were reading was not useful. </h3>
        <h3><span>Embedded Ads:</span> Drawing inspirations from the rising popularity of "native ads." The tradeoff was that it might disrupt the reading too much. But remember that I was required to put 5-7 ads on the page!</h3>

        <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/TR/discovery.png" alt="">
    <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 centered welcome">
        <h3><span>More Discovery Tools:</span> We also needed to put "newsletter signup" and "whitepaper download" somewhere. I decided that they can also be embedded into the content. And there's commenting area and more related articles at the end. </h3>

        <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/TR/interactions.png" alt="">

        <h3><span>Search Interaction:</span> Dropdown list as you type, a white overlay to imply content still behind.</h3>
        <h3><span>Topic Navigation:</span> I decided to hide it using a tap-open menu, because from the data we know people were not clicking on these topics on tablet.</h3>

        <h4>What I learned from interning at CBSi</h4>
        <h3>It was a great journey at CBSi. Alongside with this main redesign project, I also got to work on some other things, like setting up A/B testing using Optimizely, writing product specs, and communicating with stakeholders in a big company across departments and the globe.</h3>

        <h3><span>Data:</span> In a big company like CBSi, you need to justify your design decisions based on data. There's no judgment call, especially if you are an intern!</h3>

        <h3><span>Stakeholders:</span> There are many stakeholders. Sales, editorial, design, product, engineerings, users etc. Working on a redesign means you have to put yourself in between all these people and consider all their needs. It not easy.</h3>

        <h3><span>Communication:</span> Communication is key, whether you are talking about data insights or design decisions, you need to structure it like a story. There had been many times I walked in to my manager's office and screwed up because I couldn't articulate a story and make a point.</h3>
