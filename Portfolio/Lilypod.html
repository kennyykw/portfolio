				<p>Lily Pod</p><br>
				<h3>Lily Pod helps families live better and happier. One main feature is Cribsheet, a collaboration tool for caregivers. This tool allows parents and caregivers to track all caregiving activities and communicate with each others. <a href="http://www.lilypodlane.com/" target="blank">Visit Lily Pod.</a></h3>

				<h4>What do I have to do with babies?</h4>
				<h3>Since many features are still under development and conception stage, I was contracted to help design the visuals of Cribsheet. The interactions design of the whole app is not a focus here. It was under sprint that the app will use the conventional iOS tab navigation.</h3>

				<h4>Persona</h4>
				<h3>As usual, I kicked off the design by writing persona. In this case, three main personas were: parents, other caregivers, babies. (Yes babies are "stakeholders" too!) Writing persona helped me understand people's needs, frustrations, and their current solutions to problems.</h3>

				<p style="margin-bottom-20px;"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/Lilypod/persona.png" alt=""></p>

				<h3>By looking at the above personas, I was able to extract some main use cases, for example:</h3>
			


				<div class="row pt" style=" text-align:left;">
				<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
					<h3 style="font-size:18px;"><span>When</span> a working mother delegates caregiving activities to her helpers, <span>she wants</span> to see all caregiving activities (such as feeding) being performed on time, <span>so she can</span> feel less anxious.</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
					<h3 style="font-size:18px;"><span>When</span> a grandpa helps take care of his grandson, <span>he wants</span> to make sure he's doing everything right, <span>so he can</span> feel accomplished and responsible.</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
					<h3 style="font-size:18px;"><span>When</span> a baby gets taken care by a few different caregivers, <span>she wants</span> to make sure they are all on top of their games, <span>so she won't </span>have to skip a meal or wear an over-burdened diaper. </h3>
				</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Framing the Problem</h4>
				<h3>Coordinating around caregiving among multiple caregivers is physically, emotionally, and mentally challenging.</h3>

				
				<h4>Key Design Concepts</h4>
				<h3>(1) All caregiving activities to be visible to collaborators for easy tracking.</h3>
				<h3>(2) Since this product involves babies and caregiving, it should also induce feelings like love and connections.</h3>

				<h4>Reviewing Existing Design</h4>
				<p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/Lilypod/12.png" alt=""></p>

				<h4>Scalability and ...yes, card UI again</h4>
				<h3>The three main activities that can be aggregated to Cribsheet are: bottle feeding, diaper changing, sleeping. But the product owners expressed that in the future they are likely to aggregate even more activities, such as camera photo, videos, playing activities, and more. In other words, the UI had to be scalable.</h3>
				<h3>Thus the first thing that came to mind is the popular Card UI.</h3>

				<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-offset-0">
					<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/Lilypod/14.png" alt="">
						<p style="font-style:italic; color:#666;">Owners wanted to entertain the idea of having a "local community" feature, but this was later abandoned.</p>

					<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/Lilypod/15.png" alt="">
				</div>

				<h4>First Round Iterations</h4>
				<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-offset-0">
					<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/Lilypod/iteration1.png" alt="">
				</div>
				<h3>I was trying to create a visual layout that can enhance the feeling of love and connections among caregivers. Particularly, the photo of caregivers was featured with the respective caregiving activities. I was also trying to create a fancy "post-it" note animation where people will have "peel" off to reveal a "heart" that will rise to the top of the screen and fade out.</h3>

				<h4>Second Round Iterations</h4>
				<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-offset-0">
					<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/Lilypod/iteration2.png" alt="">
				</div>
				<h3>While initially I thought having a big photo of the caregiver will boost emotional connections among collaborators, I realized that it's too distractive and problematic for clear hierarchy. Also, there should be a lot of close communication (such as phone call) going on outside of the app. I decided to take out the picture. </h3>
				<h3>Another tradeoff I was considering here was whether or not to show some comments on this screen. Considering that commenting shouldn't be a primary action, I decided to hide all comments and provide a button access if users are interested.</h3>

				<h4>Third Round Iterations</h4>
				<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-md-offset-0">
					<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/Lilypod/iteration3.png" alt="">
				</div>
				<h3>After some discussions with product owners, they decided that camera generated photo and video will not be shown in Cribsheet in the forseeable future. With this in mind, I tried a more minimal look and feel. Owners liked it, but they wanted to preseve the use of activity icons. </h3>
