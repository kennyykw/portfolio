      		<h3>Sobrr is an app that redefines the experience of meeting new people. It's available for both iOS and Android.</h3>

      		<h3>Since I have done a lot of case studies for other products I've worked on already. I want to focus on sharing my experience working in an early stage post-seed startup here.</h3>

      		<h4>Imposter Syndrome is Real</h4>
      		<h3>I constantly questioned if I had any real values to offer to the company. The Sobrr team was composed of people who worked at Microsoft, Twitter, Linkedin, IBM, Amazon, Baidu, yadayada...I don't have these impressive backgrounds. I always felt like I was the dumbest in the table. But I kept my head down and did my best for all the challenges thrown at me.</h3>

      		<h4>You Gain Responsibilities, Fast.</h4>
      		<h3>Initially, I was hired as a graphic designer. My main job was to design ad graphics for marketing campaigns. But very quickly, I was asked to design for Android. What? I have never even used Android! Just when I managed to learned all the Android convention interaction patterns, I was asked to also take on product management, which means I had to prioritize features, coordinate engineering efforts, and offer strategic opinions on the product roadmap. All of this happened in less than 4 months.</h3>

      		<h4>Designing in a Chaotic Environment</h4>
      		<h3>I went to work every day feeling like I was going to wars. Yesterday we were talking about redesigning the navigation. Today we discovered a critical issue in our database causing the app down. Tomorrow we need a new design and backend implementation for chat. Unlike working for big corporation and freelancing, there's less time and more chaos to everything. There were many occasions where I skipped all the "design process" I religiously followed and arrived a pixel perfect mockup in Sketch. And I got to admit, some of them were bad.</h3>

      		<h4>I could've...</h4>
      		<h3>There were many things I could have done better. I could have pushed harder a more data-driven culture. I could have advocated more for user-centered design (I initiated a "user research" but it got lost in the torrent). I could have learned more technical skills faster and sounded smarter when talking to engineers...</h3>

      		<h4>But at the end of the day...</h4>
      		<h3>All that didn't matter. What matters is the friendships I've built during the short period of time. We had lunch and dinner everyday. We built trust in each others' works and personal integrity. And we keep in touch.</h3>

      		<h4>The Next Chapter of Sobrr</h4>
      		<h3>Our CEO decided to shift focus to the China market, and move the company HQ from San Francisco to Nanjing. Unfortunately I cannot follow. I wish best luck to everyone at Sobrr for their future destinations!</h3>
