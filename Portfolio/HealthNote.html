      	<h3>I was fortunate to be part of the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/academic.html" target="blank">IBM Watson University Competition 2014,</a> where I got a chance to work with Watson API and executives from IBM. Our team was composed of a bunch of smart engineers and business students, and I acted as the sole design person who created all the mockups, presentation materials, etc. </h3>

      	<h3>As part of the program, we had a chance to compete with other 8 Universities (such as NYU, CMU, Stanford, etc) to win $100,000 seed investment from IBM.</h3>

      	<h4>Where Watson Shines</h4>
      	<h3>Watson is good at processing unstructured data and answering questions in natural language, but it cannot do what a normal computer can, such as computing "1 + 1." Note that this might change in the future, what we had was the "baby watson"!</h3>

      	<h4>The Idea: Healthcare for India</h4>
      	<h3>Our professor had a reltionship with the biggest hospital chain in India, Apollo Hospital. Apollo agreed to provide us a limited amount of sensitive data which we can use for testing purpose. So we thought it was a good idea to go for healthcare in India. </h3>

      	<h4>The Landscape is Complicated</h4>
      	<h3>As we began to research more about healthcare in India, we realized it was a tough landscape. First, mobile internet connection, while rising rapidly, is still unstable in Inida. Second, due to various religions and believes across different regions, not everyone trusts using technology when it comes to healthcare. </h3>

      	<h4>Picking the Disease</h4>
      	<h3>"Healthcare" is big. We had to narrow down. The first intuitive thing to do was to pick a disease. As a team, after some research, we decided to go after heart diseases, because it is the number 1 killer in India (kills 4 people every minute). The trend was also scary: it is increasingly happening to the younger generation.</h3>

      	<h4>Our Initial Target Audience</h4>
      	<h3>Urban middle class aged between 25-35 who are comfortable with technology. We picked this group because it's a group that's increasingly at risk and they are more likely to be reached by technology.</h3>

      	<h4>Oops, how we do talk to our users?</h4>
      	<h3>We had a big problem: we had no access to our target users! It helped a bit that I visited India last winter, but we needed more! To solve this problem, we tried to approach our friends who come from India and asked them for information. By combining our secondary research, we were able to compile the following: </h3> <br>

    	<h4>Quora for Heart Disease</h4>
    	<h3>We generated a lot of ideas as a team, but here's the one that got developed.</h3>
    	<br>
    </div>

    	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/HealthNote/Quora-concept.png" alt="">

    <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 centered welcome">	
    	<h4>Replacing the Doctors? No Way!</h4>
    	<h3>It was clear to us early one that Watson cannot replace the doctor, just yet. Watson is not always accurate, and legally, it's a liability mess. Therefore, we tried to avoid this problem by including doctor's answers and other patients answers.</h3>

    	<h4>Community Supports for Emotional Comfort</h4>
    	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/HealthNote/iteration1.png" alt="">
    	<h3>We understood that for healthcare issues, people need emotional support, so we entertained the idea of adding community features, where people can "heart" each other and help provide answers.</h3>


    	<h4>But...people don't want ambiguity</h4>
    	<h3>After gathering feedbacks from experts, we learned that people need trusted source and answers. As a result, we decided to take out the option which everyone can answer questions, and ultimately trim down most community features to focus on the "question and answer" aspect.</h3>

    	<h4>How do you ask a question?</h4>
    	<h3>We decided from the beginning that a Messaging Interface would be intuitive for question and answer interactions.</h3>
    	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/HealthNote/asking.png" alt="">

    	<h4>The Business Model</h4>
    	<h3>To win the competition, we also had to think about the business model. This forced us to extend our thoughts beyond just users, but also partnerships and profit models. We figured that it would make more product and business sense to further narrow down and focus on a niche market.</h3>

    	<h4>Preventive or After-care?</h4>
    	<h3>We narrowed down to 2 markets to go after, and ultimately, we picked the after-care market, for 3 reasons:</h3>
    	<h3>(1) Prevention of heart diseases is highly correlated to lifestyles, which we thought it was hard to influence through a question-answer app.</h3>
    	<h3>(2) Readmission is big problem, for both hospitals and patients. Readimission rate for heart diseases in India exceeds 30%. </h3>
    	<h3>(3) There were resaerch that shows by answering simple questions readmission rates can be significantly reduced.</h3>

    	<h4>Value Propositions for Multiple Stakeholders</h4>
    	<br>
    	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/HealthNote/valueprop.png" alt="">

    	<h4>How We Make Money (Hypothetically)</h4>
    	<h3>We sell the software to hospitals. Hospitals will then require their discharged patients to use the app. Why would hospitals buy from us? Because we can help reduce readmission rate, and thus reduce cost and increase reputation.</h3>

    	<h4>Now, back to the design</h4>
    	<h3>The look and feel. We stuggled with color. We've tried blue and red before. But at the end we picked a shade of green that symbolizes comfort and health in India. 
    	<br><br> 
    	We also used images to make it more fun to look at. Meanwhile, we kept the UI clean to maintain a sense of trustworthiness. The card layout also allowed flexibility for citing various medical references to further increase credibility.</h3>
    	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/HealthNote/look.png" alt="">

    	<h3>We also optimized the flow for browsing related questions/answers:</h3>
    	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/HealthNote/browse.png" alt="">

    	<h3>The flow for asking a question:</h3>
    	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/HealthNote/ask.png" alt="">

    	<h4>Failed Case = No Confident Answer</h4>
    	<h3>One nice feature of Watson is that it can determine the confident level of an answer. We decided that we wouldn't show users answers if the confident level doesn't hit 99%. In this case, the app will prompt users to connect with doctors if it's an urgent question.</h3>

    	<h4>The Demo</h4>
    	<h3>Due to the time constraint (we only had one semester to work on this), we didn't fully implement the UI. But I used After Effects to make a demo video.</h3>
    	<iframe id="video" style="margin-bottom:20px;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NyeuFodWmqE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    	<h4>Sadly, we didn't win</h4>
    	<h3>But I've learned a lot:</h3>
    	<h3><span>Go Extra Mile:</span> The winning team from Berkeley had tested out the app with clients, contracted partners, and did a ton more research than us. If you want to win, you need to go for extra miles.</h3>
    	<h3><span>You need access to market:</span> If given a chance to choose again, we probably would avoid choosing India as our initial market. Solving a problem for people living on the other side of the globe, who have vastly different culture and habits than us, is very very hard. If I ever need to build a product for people in countries I am not familiar with again, I would probably need to travel and actually live there to learn about their culture and people.</h3>
    	<h3><span>It's Ok:</span> We had high hope at the beginning. But at the end, it's okay we didn't win. We've enjoyed the journey as a team and treasured the experience we've gained.</h3>
